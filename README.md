The Orbbec 3D camera product software development kit fully supports UVC, enabling driver-free plug-and-play. It provides both low-level and high-level APIs that are simple and easy to use, allowing developers to use it flexibly in different scenarios.

Additionally, this SDK is compatible with Orbbec's original OpenNI protocol devices through built-in code, enabling developers to migrate to Orbbec SDK to support both new and old products with one set of code.
